                                <h3>Frog-themed Self-Generating Platformer Game</h3>
                                <h4>Platfrogs</h4>
                                    <span>
                                        Platfrogs is a classic vertical platformer game where the main character is a frog whose main goal is
                                        to soar to the skies. The aim of this project was to create a frog-themed vertical platformer game using 
                                        the model-view-controller method of game design. <br><br>

                                        My partner and I decided to do this type of project because platformers are very nostalgic and familiar 
                                        to us, and we wanted to look further into how one was programmed. Furthermore, we both think frogs are quite 
                                        cute and since they're known for hopping, we thought they would be the perfect protagonists. We also wanted 
                                        to gain some familiarity with the PyGame library, and we knew that creating a platfromer game would be a 
                                        great way to explore its features.

                                <h3>Huffman Encoding and Tic-Tac-Toe Algorithms</h3>
                                    <span>
                                        For our Discrete Mathematics course, my team members and I did an exploration on both canonical and standard
                                        Huffman encoding, as well as game theory tree algorithms for tic-tac-toe. Huffman coding is a type of prefix
                                        code that uses binary trees in order to efficiently encode messages through lossless data compression. Prefix codes (also
                                        known as prefix-free binary codes) have the property that no whole codeword is the prefix for any
                                        other codeword. This enables unambiguous parsing of a variable-length code.
                                        <br><br>
                                        We wrote this paper as a way to understand the applications of trees more deeply than what was taught in class, and 
                                        ended up not only explaining but also implementing a working Huffman-encoding program in Python. The paper also explores 
                                        the minimax algorithm for tic-tac-toe and the beginnings of how to implement a function that would recursively 
                                        generate the tic-tac-toe game tree.

                                       In this project, we implemented a receiver for an acoustic modem. The program takes strings, converts 
									   them to bits, and transmits them using a high frequency cosine wave that our receiver then decodes and filters 
									   in order to get the original message. We used MATLAB to implement the receiver, and created graphs of both the
									   transmitted and received signals in the time and frequency domains.

										This was a data science project that I did with Gibson Njine. The goal of the project was to create a way to determine
										the best streaming service for an individual and visualize it in different ways. Our project analyzed the top five 
										streaming services and considered their price, the number of movies they had in a certain genre, and the ratings that
										the movies in that genre have. That way, our results are customizable to peoples' preferences and can be applied to
										a wide audience. We got our data from the WatchMode API, which had many limitations, but it was still helpful for 
										creating code that could apply to larger, more accurate datasets.

									<h3>Coffee Making Robot</h3>

											BaristaBot is a machine with integrated mechanical, electrical, and software components with the goal of

											Engineering class, where I took a lead role in project management, electrical design and power management, 
											as well as website development. <br><br>
											
											Our machine used a three-tiered rotational design where the user would place
											the cup on the bottom tier and a servo-powered platform would rotate it through four stations: creamer dispensing,
											sugar dispensing, and coffee dispensing. In between the sugar and coffee dispensing stations, water was brought
											to a boil through an induction coil and passed through a filter where the Bot has dispensed coffee grounds. 
											The user can choose if they want creamer and sugar through a touch-screen user interface that activates and deactivates
											the dispensing.

								<h3>Current Mirror Differential Amplifier Analysis</h3>
									<span>
										Through a series of three experiments, we explored the characteristics of a current mirror differential 
										amplifier circuit and compared them to a simple differential amplifier. The first experiment explored the
										voltage-transfer circuit characteristics with different values of inverting input. In the second experiment, we extracted
										the incremental transconductance, output resistance, and gain by sweeping the noninverting input around the
										inverting input in fine increments. Finally, in the third experiment we configrued the amplifier as a unity-gain
										follower with a 1nF capacitor between the amplifier output and ground. We then tested this circuit with both a small
										and large-amplitude wave as the input, and measured the output and gain for both step types.

								<h3>Bio-Inspired Mechanical Hopper</h3>

									<span>
										The hopper is a bio-inspired mechanical design project in which we went out into nature and found hopping
										animals whose jumping mechanisms to mimic as inspiration for a hopping machine. My project was inspired by
										a flea's, which is one of the animals with the largest jump in relation to its size. Fleas jump by compressing
										an elastic pad made of a protein called resilin, which essentially acts like a spring to propel their bodies
										into the air. I mimicked this by designing a flea-esque body and using a spring between the "thigh" and "calf"
										that would be compressed in the starting position and would eventually launch the hopper into the air. The trigger
										mechanism comprised of a suction cup attached to the hopper that would keep it stuck to the ground in the compressed
										position for a few seconds, before unsticking and allowing the hopper to release all of the energy stored in the spring.

								<h3>Principal Component Analysis for Optical Character Recognition</h3>

										This report analyses the creation of a computer software capable of recognising

										any problems that frequent travellers may have when travelling to other countries, or any issues that
										someone may have with translating non-digital text. Previously, in order to translate text, one would
										have to manually transcribe it into an app, which often became tedious and time-intensive. Using
										Principal Component Analysis, our system provides a viable alternative to this by automatically
										detecting text in images.
