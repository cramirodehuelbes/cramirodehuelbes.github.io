									<h2>About Me</h2>
									<p> Hi, I'm Charlotte. I'm currently pursuing a <b>B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering</b> from Olin College of 
										Engineering, a small and unique institution in Massachusetts. <br> <br>
										
										Outside of my classes, I do satellite research with 
										the <b><a href="http://osstp.org">Olin Satellite and Spectrum Technology and Policy</a></b> (OSSTP) group with the vision of creating a safe and 
										sustainable space environment for generations to come. I am currently project lead for an antenna control unit and am
										a part of the team researching equivalent power-flux density (EPFD) software. I am also an <b>Academic Resource Co-Designer 
										and course assistant for the Software Design class</b> at Olin. In the past, I've also worked as an <b>Electrical Engineering Intern</b> for
										<a href="https://www.aeroespacial.sener/en">SENER Aerospace</a>.<br><br>

										In my free time, I can be found <a href=https://cramirophoto.myportfolio.com>taking photos</a>, getting lost in my favourite book, working on my Japanese, or practicing with the

									<h3>Coffee Making Robot</h3>
									<h4>BaristaBot</h4>
										<span>
											BaristaBot is a machine with integrated mechanical, electrical, and software components with the goal of 
											making and showing the process of making coffee. This was a 6-week project for my Principles of Integrated
											Engineering class, where I took a lead role in project management, electrical design and power management, 
											as well as website development. <br><br>
											
											Our machine used a three-tiered rotational design where the user would place
											the cup on the bottom tier and a servo-powered platform would rotate it through four stations: creamer dispensing,
											sugar dispensing, and coffee dispensing. In between the sugar and coffee dispensing stations, water was brought
											to a boil through an induction coil and passed through a filter where the Bot has dispensed coffee grounds. 
											The user can choose if they want creamer and sugar through a touch-screen user interface that activates and deactivates
											the dispensing.

									<h3>Huffman Encoding and Tic-Tac-Toe Algorithms</h3>
										<span>
											For our Discrete Mathematics course, my team members and I did an exploration on both canonical and standard
											Huffman encoding, as well as game theory tree algorithms for tic-tac-toe. Huffman coding is a type of prefix
											code that uses binary trees in order to efficiently encode messages through lossless data compression. Prefix codes (also
											known as prefix-free binary codes) have the property that no whole codeword is the prefix for any
											other codeword. This enables unambiguous parsing of a variable-length code.
											<br><br>
											We wrote this paper as a way to understand the applications of trees more deeply than what was taught in class, and 
											ended up not only explaining but also implementing a working Huffman-encoding program in Python. The paper also explores 
											the minimax algorithm for tic-tac-toe and the beginnings of how to implement a function that would recursively 
											generate the tic-tac-toe game tree.

									<h3>Frog-themed Platformer Game</h3>
									<h4>Platfrogs</h4>
										<span>
											Platfrogs is a classic vertical platformer game where the main character is a frog whose main goal is
											to soar to the skies. The aim of this project was to create a frog-themed vertical platformer game using 
											the model-view-controller method of game design. <br><br>

											My partner and I decided to do this type of project because platformers are very nostalgic and familiar 
											to us, and we wanted to look further into how one was programmed. Furthermore, we both think frogs are quite 
											cute and since they're known for hopping, we thought they would be the perfect protagonists. We also wanted 
											to gain some familiarity with the PyGame library, and we knew that creating a platfromer game would be a 
											great way to explore its features.
